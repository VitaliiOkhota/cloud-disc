# cloud_disc-full-stack-app

A full-featured web application developed using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React, and Node.js) that allows users to upload, store, and download files to a cloud storage.

The application's functionality includes user registration and authentication, uploading files to storage, viewing a list of files, and downloading them. It also features the ability to delete files and search for files by name.

The web application consists of two main parts: a client-side written in React and a server-side written in Node.js using the Express.js framework. MongoDB is used for data storage.

The client-side is implemented using functional components and hooks.
